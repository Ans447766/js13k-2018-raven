Game notes:

mouse movement:
originally tried "box", stuck in corners
then tried "circle", but it just didn't behave predictably enough.
tried "moving on angle" and "arc"... just can't do it!
also, without a specific POV, moving can't rotate around the focus point.
decided to go with a crosshair instead.

when i decided to go with a centered tiled map, crosshair started acting funny
i ended up locking crosshair to the map, instead of the screen, which meant
your crosshair would "slide" on the screen as you moved unless you continually
repositioned the mouse. this would be annoying on most games where you shoot?
