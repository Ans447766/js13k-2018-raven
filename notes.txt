Game notes:

mouse movement:
originally tried "box", stuck in corners
then tried "circle", but it just didn't behave predictably enough.
tried "moving on angle" and "arc"... just can't do it!
also, without a specific POV, moving can't rotate around the focus point.
decided to go with a crosshair instead.
